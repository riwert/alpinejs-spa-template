This is an **[AlpineJS SPA template](https://github.com/riwert/alpinejs-spa-template)** with an intuitive folder structure, simple features and included examples.

<br>

The template includes the **[Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)** library, structured files with **[alpinejs-router](https://github.com/shaunlee/alpinejs-router)** for dynamic templates based on URLs, and **[alpinejs-head](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-head)** for meta updates. The design is based on the **[Tailwind Atlas theme](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/resources/atlas)**, and it functions as a SPA.

This is an **AlpineJS SPA template** with an intuitive file structure, simple features, and its examples.

Includes **[alpinejs](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)** library, structured html files with **[alpinejs-router](https://github.com/shaunlee/alpinejs-router)** for dynamic templates based on URL and **[alpinejs-head](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-head)** for meta updates. Design is based on **[tailwind atlas theme](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/resources/atlas)** and all works like a SPA.
